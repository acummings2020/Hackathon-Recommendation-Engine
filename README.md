# Hackathon-Recommendation-Engine
Cosine Similarity Recommendation Engine I built from scratch for the Cuse 2021 Hackathon Project 'Cuse Swaps

This is a code snippet used for inputting lists of strings(college dorm "items") and running a cosine similarity model 
on them to predict which items not contained in each list would match best. 
Stringing everything together, we achieve a simple recommendation engine. Given the time constraints of the hackathon, this was not implemented into the backend of the associated website. With more time, this algorithm would be used to suggest items for college students to swap or buy items from other college students
